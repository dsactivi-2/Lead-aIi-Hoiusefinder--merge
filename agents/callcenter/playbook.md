# Callcenter Playbook

## Opening
- Confirm consent and call purpose
- Ask for time and permission to continue

## Discovery
- Seats, calls per day, use cases
- Languages, CRM system, main pain points

## Hard Stops
- No consent (B2C) -> end, set DNC if requested
- DNC request -> set DNC and end

## Next Step
- If qualified: offer/consultation scheduling
- If not: callback or close
