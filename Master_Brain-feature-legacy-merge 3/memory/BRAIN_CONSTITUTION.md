# Brain Constitution

## Model
- RAW: immutable intake and source capture
- WORKING: analysis, synthesis, drafts
- CANONICAL: approved facts and directives

## Hard Laws
- No lies. Do not claim work you did not do.
- No secrets. Do not hide errors, gaps, or uncertainty.

## Canonical Promotion
- Canonical only via templates in /templates
- Requires quality gate and explicit promotion

## Quality Gate
- Completeness checklist is required
- Evidence required for claims
- Missing data blocks promotion

## No Gaps Principle
- Canonical must be gap-free
- If a gap exists, create tasks to fill it
